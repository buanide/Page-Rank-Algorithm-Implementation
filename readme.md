# Implementation of the Page Rank algorithm

 This algorithm calculates a score for each node of a graph. In the case of wikipedia or web pages, it shows how popular a page is.

 ## Compiling the program:

- Type "python3 Baptiste_Buani_Big_Data_Projet/page_rank.py Baptiste_Buani_Big_Data_Projet/paths_finished.tsv " in the terminal
(if you're in the directory above our archive, as in the previous case, you can run the same command)


- if not, go to our archive directory and type python3 page_rank.py paths_finished.tsv 


Then follow the program instructions:


- 1. choose the number of pages you want to display in descending pagerank order

- 2. choose the *damping factor*

- 3. choose the type of Page Rank you wish to apply 
         1: Classic Page Rank 
         2: Custom Page Rank". 


- 4. if the second option is selected, you'll be able to give *importance to pages containing words you've typed*, separated by a space.
